# Regex Data Extraction Project

This project is built as part of the **ALU Regex Onboarding Hackathon**. It uses **Python** and the built-in `re` module to extract specific types of data from large strings — mimicking data pulled from APIs or webpages. The goal is to use Regular Expressions to find patterns like email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit cards, times, HTML tags, hashtags, and currency amounts.

---

## Features

- Extracts **8 different types** of data using Regular Expressions:
  - Email Addresses
  - URLs
  - Phone Numbers (multiple formats)
  - Credit Card Numbers
  - Time (12-hour and 24-hour formats)
  - HTML Tags
  - Hashtags
  - Currency Amounts

- Clearly prints all matched items with total counts
- Clean, modular, and easy-to-read code
- Covers **edge cases and varied formats**

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alu_regex-data-extraction-YOUR_USERNAME.git
   cd alu_regex-data-extraction-YOUR_USERNAME
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 extract.py
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `re` module for Regex operations
- Visual Studio Code for development
